# FE595_Assignment4
For this assignment we will be exploring the sklearn Python library. 
Specifically the Linear Regression, K-means Clustering and Toy Data Sets aspects 
(which should prepare you to learn anything else about the library).

This assignment will have two major parts:

1. Using the Linear Regression class and the Boston housing data set, 
determine which element has the most influence on the price of a house in Boston. 
Be aware that the element with the "most" influence might also be the element with the "most negative" influence.
(Scripts that do not appear to consider this possibility will not earn full credit.)

2. Using K-means and the Iris or Wine data set, 
create a graph that visually displays how the total squared distance decreases as the number of clusters increases. 
Then, use the elbow heuristic to confirm or reject the assumed number of clusters on the data.

 

Make sure that each of these tasks it in its own file. 
(Also, you should not include these files in previous git projects. 
Please make a new one to keep your prior projects clean.)
